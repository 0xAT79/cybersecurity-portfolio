# About Me  
**Name:** Anna Tyler  
**Hometown:** Atlanta, Georgia, USA  

**Prior IT Experience:**  
I am new to the IT field but have always had a strong interest in technology, digital safety, and problem-solving. I enjoy learning how systems work, especially from a security perspective. My passion for protecting digital information and understanding how hackers think led me to pursue cybersecurity.

**Career Plans:**  
After completing the cybersecurity course, I plan to become a cybersecurity analyst or penetration tester. My goal is to work in a field where I can protect organizations from cyber threats, especially in education or healthcare systems. Eventually, I would like to specialize in ethical hacking or digital forensics.

**Proud Project/Task:**  
One project I'm proud of is developing a quiz generator app using the Godot game engine. The app takes notes and turns them into custom quiz questions, making studying easier and more interactive. I loved how it combined my creativity with practical coding skills, and it gave me a real sense of accomplishment.
